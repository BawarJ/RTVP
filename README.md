# Real-Time Virtual Prototypes for Power Electronics

A new model exchange format that can capture geometry-based behaviour, in addition to circuit behaviour. The concept extends an existing model exchange standard, the Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) to incorporate SPICE-like circuit models and geometrical models. Specifically designed with Power Electronics in mind, RTVP models allow complex models to be imported into commercial simulation tools such as Simulink. 

Reduced-Order Modelling methods are used to maintain simulation efficiency. A co-simulation tool is proposed that allows the models to stream 3D visualisations of their internal state, in real-time, as the simulation progresses.
