# Real Time Virtual Prototypes

## What is RTVP?

A new model exchange format that can capture geometry-based behaviour, in addition to circuit behaviour. The concept extends an existing model exchange standard, the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) to incorporate SPICE-like circuit models and geometrical models. Specifically designed with Power Electronics in mind, RTVP models allow complex models to be imported into commercial simulation tools such as Simulink. 


## How does it work?

We use our own in-house virtual prototyping software to design the model geometry. The mesh is generated for use in the simulation. After this, an FMU export option saves a number of files ready to be used in the creation of the 3D-RTVP FMU model. Internally, Reduced-Order Modelling methods are used to maintain simulation efficiency. 

A co-simulation tool is proposed that allows the models to stream 3D visualisations of their internal state, in real-time, as the simulation progresses.
